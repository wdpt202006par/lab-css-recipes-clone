          <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
            flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
            temperature and let simmer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
            lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
            that it does not run off.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes until apples are soft.
